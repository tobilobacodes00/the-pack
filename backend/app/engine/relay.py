"""The outbox relay — Postgres → Redis, the only writer to the stream.

This is the message-relay half of the transactional outbox. The Emitter writes events to
Postgres (the source of truth); this relay tails the committed-but-unpublished rows and
republishes each through the existing `EventBus.append`, then marks it relayed.

It wakes two ways:
  * `LISTEN pack_events` — Postgres delivers a notification on every committed append, so
    the relay publishes within milliseconds (the "live" path).
  * a periodic sweep (~1s) — a safety net that catches anything a missed/dropped
    notification left behind, and drains the backlog on startup.

Delivery is AT-LEAST-ONCE: _drain runs SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED → XADD → mark relayed all
inside one Postgres transaction. If the process dies before XADD the txn rolls back and the row
stays unrelayed for the next pass. If it dies after commit the event is both published and marked
— no loss. A duplicate publish (XADD ok, commit fail) is a no-op: the frontend reducer drops
seq <= lastSeq.
