"""The Boundary — a gate BEFORE the call, not a graph after it (Doc 04 §04, F7).

Every LLM and tool call passes a gate that checks PROJECTED spend before dispatch:
  * 70%  -> emit boundary_warning
  * 85%  -> apply the downgrade policy (flash-tier non-critical wolves, thinking off where
            safe) and emit boundary_downgrade
  * 100% -> BLOCK the call, checkpoint, and emit boundary_halt

This must INTERCEPT, never merely observe. It is the market gap we demonstrate. First hunts carry a
silent cap (settings.first_hunt_cap_usd — 3.00 by default; the prod template lowers it to 0.50)
regardless of the approved boundary. Per-wolf sub-budgets are enforced the same way.

Scaffold: the thresholds and the gate signature are fixed here; the engine wires dispatch
through `check()` so no call can escape it. See fixtures/boundary_halt.jsonl for the
expected event sequence and backend/tests for the assertion that nothing dispatches >100%.
