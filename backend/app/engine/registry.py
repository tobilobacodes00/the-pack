"""The hunt registry — live, in-process hunt handles (Doc 04 §6).

REST commands return 202 immediately; the running Supervisor is what actually acts. The
registry is the bridge: it maps `hunt_id` to the Supervisor's asyncio task plus a command
queue. A REST handler pushes a command (approve plan, resolve hold, stop) onto the queue
and returns; the Supervisor, blocked on `commands.get()`, picks it up and emits the
resulting events in proper seq order through the one Emitter.
