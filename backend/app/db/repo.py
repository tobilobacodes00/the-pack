"""The repository — every Postgres read and write the engine needs (Doc 04 §5).

This is the only module that speaks SQL. The Emitter (app/engine/core.py) calls
`append_event`; the outbox relay (app/engine/relay.py) calls `fetch_unrelayed` +
`mark_relayed`; the REST layer calls the hunt/instinct/artifact helpers.

`append_event` writes the event AND fires `pg_notify('pack_events', hunt_id)` in the SAME
transaction. The notify reaches the relay only on commit, so the relay is woken precisely
when there is a durably-committed event to publish — the heart of the outbox pattern.
