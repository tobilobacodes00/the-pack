-- Add referential integrity — FK constraints with ON DELETE CASCADE for child tables so that
-- delete_hunt (and any out-of-band cleanup) propagates atomically.
--
-- Preamble: remove any orphaned child rows first. 0001_initial created the tables without FKs, so
-- orphans can exist on an older database. Adding a FK with orphaned rows would fail.
