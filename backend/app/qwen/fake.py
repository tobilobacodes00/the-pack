"""FakeQwen — the deterministic, offline brain (Doc 04 §07, F14 fallback).

When there is no API key, the whole system still runs end to end: REST → Supervisor →
Emitter → Postgres → relay → Redis → gateway → canvas. The only thing swapped out is the
model call. FakeQwen returns canned-but-plausible text AND, for the structured calls the real
engine makes (plan, findings, merge, critique, gaps), a deterministic object SHAPED LIKE the
requested `response_schema` and woven from the actual task — so the dynamic engine exercises
the same code path offline, topic-aware, with realistic synthetic usage so the Boundary moves.

It is deterministic: same spec in, same result out (no clocks, no randomness). The moment a
real `QWEN_API_KEY` lands, `QwenClient` stops routing here — zero change to the Supervisor or
the event stream.
