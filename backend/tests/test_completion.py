"""Engine completion tests — the features that were stubbed/dead now fire, all offline.

Covers: plan edits (A6), mid-hunt input (A7), and Stray timeout detection/recovery (A3).
Parallel scouts (A1), web_fetch (A4), and real Standoffs (A2) are exercised by the existing
offline-hunt tests; here we add the paths those don't reach.
