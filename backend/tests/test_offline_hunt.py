"""The offline hunt — the whole engine runs end to end with no key and no infrastructure.

Drives the REAL Supervisor (real Emitter, real Boundary, real QwenClient in offline mode, the
real strategy package) over an in-memory repo and asserts the engine's invariants: dense seq,
every event valid against the FROZEN schema, the Boundary respected, the hunt opens with
`hunt_created` and closes with `hunt_completed`, and the live-research lifecycle is present.

This is the proof that the pipeline is correct before the model key ever arrives. It no longer
pins the exact event MULTISET to a hand-authored fixture (the engine is now dynamic and
strategy-driven); it tests the invariants the contract actually guarantees.
