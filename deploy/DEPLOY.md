This guide assumes you have an Alibaba Cloud account and access to the code.
You do not need to know how to code. Just follow each step in order.

If anything goes wrong, the **Troubleshooting** section at the bottom has the common fixes.

## Verify the production stack locally FIRST (for developers)

Before provisioning any cloud, prove the exact production images run end-to-end on your own machine.
This catches image/config problems in minutes instead of on a live server. You need Docker Desktop.

```bash
# 1. Config: copy the template and point it at a throwaway local Postgres + Redis.
cp deploy/.env.prod.example deploy/.env.prod
#    In deploy/.env.prod set POSTGRES_URL / REDIS_URL to reachable instances (or run local
#    containers), set a real QWEN_API_KEY (or leave blank to run the deterministic offline brain),
#    and set STRICT_SECRETS=false for this local smoke test.

# 2. Password file (the web container mounts it; the stack won't serve without it).
htpasswd -bc deploy/.htpasswd test test   # user "test", password "test"

# 3. Build + run the full production stack (engine + gateway + web/nginx).
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```

Then confirm, in another terminal / the browser:

```bash
# Health (unauthenticated) — engine + gateway must answer.
curl -s http://localhost/healthz            # -> ok            (nginx)
curl -su test:test http://localhost/api/health   # -> {"status":"ok"}   (engine, behind Basic auth)
curl -su test:test http://localhost/ws/health    # -> ok            (gateway)
```

- Open `http://localhost`, enter `test` / `test` at the Basic-auth prompt.
- Start a hunt and confirm **events stream onto the canvas over `/ws/`** (this proves the gateway
  env var, the WS proxy, and the outbox relay all line up).
- Upload a **> 1 MB** PDF in the Door and confirm it parses (proves the nginx body cap + the engine's
  document deps are present in the image).
- When the brief returns, **download it as PDF/DOCX** (proves the Forge renderers are in the image).

If any of those fail, the production images are wrong — fix them before touching the cloud. All four
were changed recently (non-root images, the `/ws` env var, the 25 MB nginx cap, the engine
dependency install), so this local run is their first real end-to-end exercise.

## What you are setting up

You need 5 things on Alibaba Cloud:

1. **A server (ECS)** — the machine that runs the app
2. **A database (RDS Postgres)** — stores all hunts and conversations
3. **A cache (Tair/Redis)** — streams live events to the browser
4. **A Qwen API key** — the AI brain that powers the pack
5. **A bucket (OSS)** — stores the forged files (PDF/DOCX/…) the pack produces
   *(optional — leave the `OSS_*` env vars empty and files fall back to the server's local disk)*

And 1 thing from outside Alibaba:

5. **A Tavily API key** — gives the pack real web search ability

Everything should be in the **same region**. Use **Singapore (ap-southeast-1)** — it's the closest region with full Qwen support.

---

## Before you start — accounts you need

- [ ] Alibaba Cloud account with billing enabled
- [ ] A Tavily account (free) — sign up at https://tavily.com
- [ ] The Pack codebase on your computer (or a GitHub repo)

---

## Part 1 — Create the database (RDS Postgres)

This is where all hunt data is saved permanently.

1. Log into Alibaba Cloud console → search for **"RDS"** in the search bar → click **ApsaraDB RDS**
2. Click **Create Instance**
3. Fill in:
   - **Engine:** PostgreSQL
   - **Version:** 16
   - **Region:** Singapore (ap-southeast-1)
   - **Edition:** Basic (cheapest option)
   - **Instance class:** pg.n2.small.1 (1 core, 2 GB — enough to start)
   - **Storage:** 20 GB SSD
4. Click through to payment and confirm — it will take about 5 minutes to be ready

Once it's running:

5. Click on the instance → go to the **Accounts** tab
   - Click **Create Account**
   - Username: `pack`
   - Type: Standard Account
   - Password: make something strong and **write it down** — you will need it later
   
6. Go to the **Databases** tab
   - Click **Create Database**
   - Name: `pack`
   - Owner: `pack` (the account you just created)

7. Go to the **Connection** tab
   - Find the **Internal Endpoint** (it looks like `rm-xxxxxxxx.pg.rds.aliyuncs.com`)
   - **Copy and save this** — you will need it later

The database is ready. Leave this tab open.

---

## Part 2 — Create the cache (Tair/Redis)

This is what streams live events to the browser while a hunt is running.

1. In the Alibaba console → search for **"Tair"** → click **ApsaraDB for Redis (Tair)**
2. Click **Create Instance**
3. Fill in:
   - **Type:** Community Edition (Redis compatible)
   - **Version:** Redis 7.0
   - **Region:** Singapore (same as your database — important)
   - **Architecture:** Standard (single node)
   - **Memory:** 1 GB
4. Confirm and wait for it to be ready (~3 minutes)

Once running:

5. Click on the instance → **Security** → **Password Management**
   - Set a password and **write it down**

6. Go to the **Connection** tab
   - Copy the **Internal Endpoint** (looks like `r-xxxxxxxx.redis.rds.aliyuncs.com:6379`)
   - **Save this**

---

## Part 2.5 — Create the file store (OSS)  *(optional)*

This is where the pack keeps the files it forges (the PDF/DOCX/PPTX/PNG you download). If you skip
this, the app still works — files just live on the server's disk instead. Setting it up is the
Alibaba Cloud **OSS** (Object Storage Service) integration the hackathon rules want demonstrated;
the code path is `backend/app/storage/oss.py`.

1. In the Alibaba console → search **"OSS"** → click **Object Storage Service** → **Buckets** → **Create Bucket**
2. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `pack-artifacts` (must be globally unique — add a suffix if taken)
   - **Region:** Singapore (same as everything else)
   - **Storage Class:** Standard
   - Leave **ACL** = Private (the app streams files back out itself — the bucket stays private)
3. Create it.

Now make a key the app can use:

4. In the console → search **"RAM"** → **Users** → **Create User**
   - Enable **OpenAPI access** (this gives you an AccessKey ID + Secret — **write both down**)
5. Give that user OSS access: **Add Permissions** → attach **`AliyunOSSFullAccess`**
6. **Save these 4 values** for the `.env.prod` file:
   - `OSS_BUCKET` = `pack-artifacts`
   - `OSS_ENDPOINT` = `https://oss-ap-southeast-1.aliyuncs.com`
   - `OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` = the AccessKey ID
   - `OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` = the AccessKey Secret

---

## Part 3 — Create the server (ECS)

This is the machine that runs the app, the AI engine, and the live streaming.

1. In the Alibaba console → search **"ECS"** → click **Elastic Compute Service**
2. Click **Create Instance**
3. Fill in:
   - **Region:** Singapore (same region as your database and cache — very important)
   - **Image:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64-bit
   - **Instance type:** ecs.c6.xlarge (4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM) — do not go smaller
   - **Storage:** 40 GB Enhanced SSD
   - **Network:** Make sure it is in the same VPC as your RDS and Tair
   - **Public IP:** tick "Assign public IP" — you need this to access the server from outside
4. Under **Security Group** — create a new one with these rules:
   - Allow TCP port **22** (SSH — for you to connect)
   - Allow TCP port **80** (HTTP — for the app)
   - Allow TCP port **443** (HTTPS — for secure access later)
5. Set a root password or SSH key (SSH key is safer — use one if you have it)
6. Confirm and wait (~2 minutes)

Once running:
7. Copy the **Public IP address** — you will use this to access the app
8. Copy the **Private IP address** — you need to whitelist it in RDS and Tair

### Whitelist the server in the database and cache

Go back to your **RDS instance** → **Whitelist** tab:
- Click **Add Whitelist Group** → add the server's **private IP** → save

Go back to your **Tair instance** → **Whitelist** tab:
- Same thing — add the server's **private IP** → save

This allows your server to connect to the database and cache.

---

## Part 4 — Get the API keys

### Qwen (the AI)

1. Go to: https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com
2. Sign in with your Alibaba Cloud account
3. Click **API Keys** in the left menu → **Create API Key**
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`) and save it

### Tavily (web search)

1. Go to: https://tavily.com
2. Click Sign Up → create a free account
3. After logging in, your API key is on the dashboard
4. Copy it (starts with `tvly-`) and save it

---

## Part 5 — Connect to the server and set it up

You need a terminal app to connect to the server. On Mac it's built in. On Windows, use **PuTTY** or the built-in Windows Terminal.

### Connect via SSH

```
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP
```

Replace `YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP` with the IP you copied in Part 3.

If it asks "are you sure you want to continue connecting" — type `yes` and press Enter.

### Install Docker

Copy and paste this entire block into the terminal — press Enter and wait for it to finish (~2 minutes):

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

Check it worked:
```bash
docker --version
```
You should see something like `Docker version 26.x.x` — any version number is fine.

---

## Part 6 — Upload the code to the server

**If the code is on GitHub:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-pack.git
cd the-pack
```

**If the code is on your computer (run this from your computer, not the server):**
```bash
rsync -av --exclude='node_modules' --exclude='.venv' --exclude='target' \
  "/path/to/the pack/" root@YOUR_SERVER_IP:~/the-pack/
```

Then on the server:
```bash
cd ~/the-pack
```

---

## Part 7 — Fill in your secrets

This is the most important step. You are creating a file that tells the app all the passwords and keys it needs.

On the server, run:
```bash
cp deploy/.env.prod.example deploy/.env.prod
nano deploy/.env.prod
```

This opens a text editor. Fill in the values below. Use the arrow keys to move around, edit the text, then press **Ctrl+X**, then **Y**, then **Enter** to save.

Here is what to change — replace every `replace-me` with your real values:

```
QWEN_API_KEY=          ← paste your Qwen key here (the sk-... one)
SEARCH_API_KEY=        ← paste your Tavily key here (the tvly-... one)

POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://pack:YOUR_RDS_PASSWORD@YOUR_RDS_INTERNAL_ENDPOINT:5432/pack
               ← replace YOUR_RDS_PASSWORD with the password from Part 1
               ← replace YOUR_RDS_INTERNAL_ENDPOINT with the endpoint from Part 1

REDIS_URL=redis://:YOUR_TAIR_PASSWORD@YOUR_TAIR_INTERNAL_ENDPOINT:6379/0
               ← replace YOUR_TAIR_PASSWORD with the password from Part 2
               ← replace YOUR_TAIR_INTERNAL_ENDPOINT with the endpoint from Part 2

SESSION_SECRET=        ← generate one by running this command and pasting the result:
                          python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

CORS_ORIGINS=          ← your real site, e.g. https://yourdomain.com (leave the localhost default only for testing)
```

**Also verify the pricing block.** The `PRICE_*` lines drive the spend cap (the Boundary). The
template ships realistic ballpark rates, but if they are wrong the cap can let a hunt overspend. Open
your Qwen Model Studio console, find the real per-1M-token rates for your tier/region, and update the
`PRICE_MAX_*` / `PRICE_PLUS_*` / `PRICE_FLASH_*` lines to match before launch.

**Example of what a filled-in file looks like:**
```
QWEN_API_KEY=sk-abc123def456...
SEARCH_API_KEY=tvly-xyz789...
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://pack:MyStr0ngPass@rm-abc123.pg.rds.aliyuncs.com:5432/pack
POSTGRES_SSLMODE=require
REDIS_URL=redis://:MyRedisPwd@r-def456.redis.rds.aliyuncs.com:6379/0
SESSION_SECRET=a3f9c2d81b4e7f6a...
OSS_BUCKET=pack-artifacts
OSS_ENDPOINT=https://oss-ap-southeast-1.aliyuncs.com
OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=LTAI5t...
OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=abc123...
```
*(Skipping OSS? Leave the four `OSS_*` lines empty — forged files fall back to the server's disk.)*

---

## Part 8 — Start the app

```bash
cd ~/the-pack/deploy
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

This will:
- Build the app (takes **5–10 minutes** the first time — the Rust gateway compiles from scratch)
- Start 3 containers: the Python engine, the Rust live-stream gateway, and nginx

Watch the build with:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f
```

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop watching the logs (the app keeps running).

When it's done, check everything is running:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

You should see 3 rows, all showing **Up** or **running**.

---

## Part 9 — Check it works

Run these checks one by one:

```bash
# Check the engine is alive
curl http://localhost/api/health
# Should print: {"status":"ok"}

# Check the live-stream gateway is alive
curl http://localhost/ws/health
# Should print: ok
```

Then open a browser and go to:
```
http://YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP
```

You should see The Pack. Start a test hunt and confirm events flow through to the canvas.

> ⚠️ **The app is OPEN right now.** Anyone who knows the IP can use it, spend your Qwen/Tavily
> budget, read your hunts, and delete data. **Do NOT share the address until you finish Part 10.**

---

## Part 10 — Lock it down (REQUIRED before sharing): password + HTTPS

This does two things: puts a **password** in front of the whole app, and turns on **HTTPS** so
traffic (including that password) is encrypted. Do both before anyone else gets the link.

### 10a — Set a password

```bash
# Install the htpasswd tool
sudo apt-get install -y apache2-utils

# Create the password file (replace 'team' with a username; it will prompt for a password)
cd ~/the-pack/deploy
htpasswd -c .htpasswd team
```

The compose file already mounts this file into the web container. Anyone opening the site will now be
asked for the username and password you just set.

### 10b — Turn on HTTPS

You need a domain name pointing to your server's public IP first. Set an A record in your DNS provider
pointing `yourdomain.com` to the server IP, then wait ~10 minutes for it to propagate.

Then on the server:

```bash
# Install Certbot
sudo apt-get install -y certbot

# Stop the web container temporarily (needs port 80 free)
cd ~/the-pack/deploy
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop web

# Get a free SSL certificate (replace yourdomain.com with your real domain)
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com

# Restart the web container
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml start web
```

Then open `deploy/nginx.conf` and replace its contents with this (swap in your domain). Note the
ports are **8080 / 8443** — the web container runs as a non-root user and maps to host 80/443 via the
compose file.

```nginx
server {
    listen 8080;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 8443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;
    client_max_body_size 25m;

    # Password gate for the whole app (the file from step 10a).
    auth_basic           "The Pack";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

    location = /healthz { auth_basic off; access_log off; add_header Content-Type text/plain; return 200 "ok\n"; }

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://engine:8000/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /ws/ {
        proxy_pass http://gateway:8080/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
        proxy_send_timeout 3600s;
    }
}
```

Also mount the certificates and open port 443 — under the `web` service in `docker-compose.prod.yml`,
add the letsencrypt volume and the 443 mapping (the `.htpasswd` volume is already there):
```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./.htpasswd:/etc/nginx/.htpasswd:ro
      - /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt:ro
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
      - "443:8443"
```

Then rebuild the web container:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build web
```

Now the app works at `https://yourdomain.com`, behind a password. It is safe to share.

---

## Updating the app (when there's new code)

```bash
cd ~/the-pack
git pull
cd deploy
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

That's it. Docker only rebuilds what changed. The app restarts with the new code in under a minute.

---

## Viewing logs (if something goes wrong)

```bash
# See everything happening right now
cd ~/the-pack/deploy
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# See only the AI engine logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f engine

# See only the live-stream gateway logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f gateway
```

Press Ctrl+C to stop watching.

---

## Troubleshooting

**The app doesn't load at all**
- Make sure your ECS security group allows port 80 inbound
- Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps` — are all 3 containers Up?
- If not, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs web` to see the error

**"Couldn't reach Alpha" error in the chat**
- Your `QWEN_API_KEY` is wrong or missing
- Open `deploy/.env.prod`, check the key, then restart: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart engine`

**Hunts don't stream live (canvas is empty)**
- Your `REDIS_URL` is wrong, or the Tair whitelist doesn't include your server's private IP
- Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs gateway` — if it shows a Redis connection error, fix the URL and whitelist

**Database connection errors in the engine logs**
- Your `POSTGRES_URL` is wrong, or the RDS whitelist doesn't include your server's private IP
- Double-check the internal endpoint — it should be the VPC one, not the public one

**The build takes forever or fails on the gateway**
- The Rust compiler needs time and memory — first build is ~5 min on 8 GB RAM
- If it runs out of memory, add a swap file:
  ```bash
  sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
  sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
  sudo mkswap /swapfile
  sudo swapon /swapfile
  ```
  Then try the build again.

**Scouts always return empty search results**
- Your `SEARCH_API_KEY` is missing — the engine falls back to fake (canned) results
- Add the Tavily key to `.env.prod` and restart the engine container

## Monthly cost estimate

| What | Approx. cost (Singapore) |
|------|--------------------------|
| ECS server (4 core / 8 GB) | $60–80/month |
| RDS Postgres (1 core / 2 GB) | $25–35/month |
| Tair/Redis (1 GB) | $15–20/month |
| Public IP address | $5/month |
| Qwen AI (per hunt) | ~$0.05–$0.20 per hunt |
| Tavily search | Free (up to ~1000 searches/month) |
| **Total fixed** | **~$105–140/month** |

Qwen and Tavily only cost money when someone actually uses the app. The rest is fixed.
